# Tangram2

A 2D image software mainly focused on the possibility to write your own fragment shaders (in a Shadertoy-like fashion). This is version 2, rebuilt with an ECS architecture.

Version 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Tangram) (most of the code hasn't been moved to version 2 yet)
